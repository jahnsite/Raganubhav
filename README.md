# Raganubhav

**A raga** is a particular arrangement of notes with evoke distinct emotions. 
Raganubhav is my attempt for users to explore ragas and the particular emotions they evoke with **tactile interactions**. 
User group: Aimed to be accessible for those with limited musical background.

- [gui1.py](https://github.com/jahnsite/Raganubhav/blob/main/gui1.py) contains the back-end functioning of the UI.
- [gui1.ui](https://github.com/jahnsite/Raganubhav/blob/main/gui1.ui) is the computer user interface and demonstrates the project's purpose. The ultimate goal is to seamlessly integrate it into a device for optimal use.
- [data_packet.json](https://github.com/jahnsite/Raganubhav/blob/main/data_packet.json) defines the timing and beats at which the selected notes play.

- To run the GUI:
```
python3 gui1.py
```

### Team
- Raghav Thakar (Developed the functioning of the device)
- Jahnavi Kolakaluri (UI Implementation and Design)

### Timeline
- 2 months design exploration and development; implementation on going.

### Tools Used
- Python
- Arduino NANO V3.0

### User Flow
1. User selects notes for each of the 8 beats
2. The device will play the 8 beats on loop
3. As the user changes a note, the output sound dynamically adjusts, providing an opportunity to experiment with distinct sounds and emotions through varied note selection.
